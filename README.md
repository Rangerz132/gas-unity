# Unity GAS

![gas-unity-banner](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkVBwZVjC.png)

## Overview
This project implements a **Gameplay Ability System (GAS)** in Unity. The GAS provides a framework for defining and executing abilities for characters in a game, allowing for modular, reusable, and scalable gameplay mechanics.

## Features

Each ability in this system is composed of multiple interchangeable **ScriptableObjects**, making it easy for designers to create, modify, and balance abilities without needing to write code. This modular approach ensures that abilities can be customized and fine-tuned with ease, providing a flexible toolkit for game designers.

- **Ability Definitions**: Create and manage abilities with various effects, such as damage, healing, buffs, debuffs, and more.
- **Attribute System**: Manage character attributes (e.g., health, mana, stamina) and integrate them with abilities.
- **Pool System**: Use events to trigger and respond to ability-related actions to release objects when needed.

### Abilities

The system allows for the creation of abilities that can perform a wide range of actions. Each ability can have different components, including:

* **Targeting System**: Define and handle different targeting methods for abilities.
    * Area-of-effect (AoE)
        * Circle Zone
        * Square Zone
        * *More to come (WIP)*
    * Single-target
    * Self-targeting.
    * Directional.

* **Cooldown and Cost Management**: Implement cooldowns and mana cost for abilities:
    * Time cooldown
    * Stack cooldown
    * Mana cost

* **Filters**: Define criteria to select only targets that meet specific requirements.
    * Tags (Player, Enemy..)
    * Health (Dead, Alive, Health Amount...)
    * *More to come (WIP)*

* **Effects**: Implement list of effects.
    * Health 
        * Damage
        * Heal
    * Animation
        * Set Boolean variable
        * Set Float variable
        * Set Trigger variable
    * Camera
        * Camera Shake
    * Buff / Debuff
        * Stats
        * *More to come (WIP)*
    * Spawn
        * Spawn Prefab
        * Spawn Prefab at target
        * Spawn Projectile Prefab
        * Spawn Projectile Spray Prefab
        * Spawn Projectile Barrage Prefab
        * *More to come (WIP)*
    * Transform
        * Look At Target
    * Composite
        * Delay

    * *More to come (WIP)*

### Stats and Derived Stats
The GAS includes a robust system for managing character stats and derived stats, which are used to calculate various in-game effects and outcomes. These stats are crucial in determining a character's effectiveness in combat, resource management, and overall gameplay performance.


#### Base Stats
Base stats are the fundamental attributes of a character. These stats influence the derived stats and directly affect the character's capabilities. The following base stats are included:

- **Constitution**: 
    - Increases the maximum amount of health a character can have.
- **Endurance**: 
    - Increases the maximum amount of stamina a character can possess.
    - Accelerates the rate at which a character replenishes stamina.
- **Strength**: 
    - Enhances the damage a character deals through physical attacks.
    - Increases the maximum weight of items a character can carry without penalties. *(Weight system not yet implemented)*

- **Dexterity**: 
    - Improves a character's ability to land hits on a target. *(Accuracy system not yet implemented)*
    - Increases the rate at which a character can perform consecutive attacks. *(Attack speed system not yet implemented)*
    - Raises the likelihood of a character landing a critical hit, causing extra damage. *(Critical Hit Chance system not yet implemented)*
    - Increases a character's ability to avoid incoming attacks. *(Evasion system not yet implemented)*
    - Enhances the speed at which a character moves across the game world. *(Movement speed system not yet implemented)*
- **Intelligence**: 
    - Boosts the amount of damage a character inflicts with magical abilities.
    - Boosts a character's ability to resist or reduce magic damage taken
- **Luck**: System not yed implemented.
- **Charisma**: System not yed implemented.
- **Wisdom**: 
    - Reduces the time it takes for a character's abilities to become usable again after being cast.
    - Increases the maximum amount of mana available for casting spells.
    - Accelerates the rate at which a character replenishes mana.


These stats are designed to provide a deep and flexible system for character customization and progression, allowing for a wide range of gameplay styles and strategies.

#### Derived Stats
Derived stats are calculated based on the base stats and determine various in-game effects. These stats are automatically updated when the base stats change. The following derived stats are included:

- **MaxHealth**: The maximum amount of health a character can have.
- **MaxMana**: The maximum amount of mana a character can have.
- **MaxStamina**: The maximum amount of stamina a character can have.
- **MagicDamage**: The amount of damage dealt by magical abilities.
- **PhysicalDamage**: The amount of damage dealt by physical attacks.
- **Accuracy**: The likelihood of hitting a target. *(Not yet implemented)*
- **Evasion**: The likelihood of avoiding an attack. *(Not yet implemented)*
- **CriticalHitChance**: The chance of dealing a critical hit. *(Not yet implemented)*
- **MovementSpeed**: The speed at which a character moves. *(Not yet implemented)*
- **AttackSpeed**: The speed at which a character can attack. *(Not yet implemented)*
- **MagicResistance**: The character's ability to resist magical damage.
- **PhysicalResistance**: The character's ability to resist physical damage.
- **HealthRegeneration**: The rate at which a character regenerates health over time.
- **StaminaRegeneration**: The rate at which a character regenerates stamina over time.
- **ManaRegeneration**: The rate at which a character regenerates mana over time.
- **AbilityCooldown**: The reduction in cooldown time for abilities.
- **MaxWeight**: The maximum amount of weight a character can carry. *(Not yet implemented)*
